Problem Statement addressed :[ Public transport is  a challenge for every country in addition Traffic jams cost the US a staggering $87 billion in lost productivity per year. 

Citizens in every city now use data from smartphones navigation to work around traffic. Since current services on the market do not provide real time car congestion, its difficult to predict traffic flow, demand user flow, demography effect by region, weather conditions, planned or unplanned events, street size and roads, traffic lights optimization.

This difficulty leads to every day user to get up to 2-4 hours of the day wasted on the traffic, leading to high stress, low productivity, high energy consumption, no income generator or incentives.

Tell us how your entry was the most...

Impactful in solving a real world problem Following the ODS Agenda 2030 Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.  based on this our proposal goal is create a system  that learns as information changes, and as goals and requirements evolve. It resolves ambiguity and tolerates unpredictability. It is engineered to feed on dynamic data in real time.

Innovative use case of graph This framework has many advantages for building multidimensional time series data: 1. The framework can maintain the original data representation in the form of a matrix. 2. The framework can reduce the amount of parameters in autoregressive model.
 in addition it provide data privacy protections  and at the same time the algorithms understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as, syntax, time, location, appropriate regulation, user profile, process, task and goal.
